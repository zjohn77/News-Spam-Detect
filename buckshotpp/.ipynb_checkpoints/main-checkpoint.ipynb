    "### Buckshot++: A Scalable, Noise-Tolerant Bagging Approach to  Clustering.  \n",
    "Despite the k-means algorithm being one of the most important unsupervised learning methods today, the Achilles' heel of this algorithm is the need to determine beforehand the number of clusters. A common way to find K is like this: take some metric, evaluate at multiple values of K, and let some greedy search determine when to stop (typically elbow heuristic). Here, I show a better way. I introduce 3 improvements:   \n",
    "1. I show that some metrics are powerful, while others are too inconsistent to be useful\n",
    "2. A big problem with k-means is that every single point is clustered--but what we really want is the pattern and not the noise. I show a beautiful way to solve this problem--and much simpler than k-medoids and k-medians to boot. \n",
    "3. Running k-means multiple times to find the best K is expensive in computation time, and just doesn't scale. I show a surprisingly simple alternative that *does* scale. "

    "#### Bagging *does* make sense here!\n",
    "Each green curve is generated from a bootstrap sample, and the red curve is their average. Remember the sources of instability for k-means listed in Table 1? One instability is outlier. The concept of outlier has a somewhat different meaning in the context of clustering. In supervised learning, an outlier is a rare observation that happens to be far from other observations. In clustering, a far away observation is its own well-separated cluster. So my interpretation is that \"rare\" is the operative word here and that outliers are singleton clusters that exert undue influence on the formation of other clusters. Look at how [bagging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_aggregating) imparted a more stable estimate of the relationship between the number of clusters and the silhouette score in the graph below."

    "The fact is that hierarchical clustering has a much higher order of time complexity than k-means. This means that, for sizable inputs, running k-means multiple times is still faster than running hierarchical clustering just once. The Buckshot algorithm runs hierarchical just once on a small sample in order to initialize cluster centers for k-means. Since O(N^2 * logN) grows really fast, the sample must be really small to make it work computationally. But a key critique of Buckshot is [failure to find the right structure with a small sample](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.136.7906&rep=rep1&type=pdf).  "
